This example demonstrates a common error in VBScript when using the GetObject function to interact with COM objects. The original code lacks proper error handling, which can cause unexpected crashes if the object is not available. The solution shows how to implement error handling to gracefully handle this scenario, either retrieving an existing object or creating a new one if necessary.
